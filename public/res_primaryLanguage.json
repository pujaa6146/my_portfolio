NGOs will be able to get the right donater based on nearest location (thanks to Expo SDK's Geocoding API) and the items they are willing to donate. NGOs can then establish contact with the donater via email. Had lots of fun while developing this app and gained hands-on experience with ReactNative & NodeJS.",
